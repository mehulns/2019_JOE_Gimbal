\section{Conclusions}

Acoustic probe was developed for continuous measurements of the Mn crust.
Previous results have showed the effect of angle of incidence on the intensity of the acoustic reflection. 
The system was gimbaled to align the probe parallel to the seafloor
AUV was developed using this concept and deployed at an underwater seamount
Results from the trials showed the necessity for such a system to obtain Mn crust thickness measurements.
